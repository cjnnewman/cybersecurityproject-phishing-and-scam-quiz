This is the repository for the CEN 3073 Computer security Project 4 Team 1 project files. Our project is a web application using NextJS that is an assessment for individuals to test their ability to detect and determine different forms of phishing and malicous content that most people will encounter. The site does require individuals to sign up for access to the project, this is so that assessment scores are saved for each member that attemps the assessment quiz.
